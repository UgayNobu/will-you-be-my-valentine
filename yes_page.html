            <p><strong>Hey Tenzin ❤️</strong></p>

            <p>
                Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. I just want you to know how much you truly mean to me. 
                I might not always know the best way to show my love, and sometimes I struggle to express 
                it properly, but please believe me when I say my love for you is real and honest. 
                It comes from my heart.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though we don’t get to meet often, my feelings for you have never changed. 
                If anything, they’ve only grown stronger. I love you so much, more than I probably say out loud. 
                You’re not just my girlfriend, you’re the love of my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Will you be my Valentine? 💌</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I actually wanted to ask you out tomorrow on Feb 14 and spend the day with you, 
                but because of family gatherings and some pressure from my parents, 
                I won’t be able to go out tomorrow. I’m really sorry it had to be this way. 
                I promise I want to make it up to you the very next day and make it special for us.
            </p>

            <p>
                Are you free on Sunday? I would really love to take you out and spend proper time together.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love you so much, Tenzin. Always. ❤️
